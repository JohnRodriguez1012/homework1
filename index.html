				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<div id="section_grey_line"></div>
				<img id="profile_image" src="assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="My Pic">
				<p>A recent Randolph-Macon graduate, I am a hardworking individual trying to broaden my work experience During my time at Randolph Macon, I was elected not only two presidential roles, but also a co-chair role for the College Judicial Board: I served as the president of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity (two consecutive years), and the Sexual Assault Prevention & Awareness organization (two consecutive years), and as well as co-chair for the College Judicial Council for one year. On top of all of this, I also took part in numerous extracurricular and volunteer activities at school and in the local community. With a strong educational background and solid experience in leadership roles.</p>
				<br>
				<p>After college, I jumped into the insurance world. I previously worked for Elephant Insurance located in Richmond, Virginia as a sales agent. After several months as an agent, I was moved into a project role within the customer service department After bringing back several recommendations to the department, I applied to be a recruiter. When I joined the team, I recruited strictly for our customer service department and then recruited for all call center positions within our Virginia office and higher level claims positions in the Texas office. I restructured the recruitment process for the call center departments and recruited for our Business Information department .</p>
				<br>
				<p>After taking some time to deal with family matters, I decided to pursue new career opportunities. I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Flex Program at the University of Richmond. As a part time student, I am looking for part time opportunities with the IT field..</p>
